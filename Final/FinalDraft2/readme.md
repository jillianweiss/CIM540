## Possible Ideas

### 1. Data  Visualization
#### View the top 25 box office opening weekend movie releases of 2017 and change the view based on production studio, date, etc. 
##### Data from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/

### 2. Using the Play Library
#### Make a cute little game using sprites.


### 3. Data Visualization
#### I have no idea what to dow with this but hopefully something cool.
