# Final Project

## Possible Ideas

### 1. Data  Visualization
 View the all time best 100 box office opening weekend movie releases and changing the view based on production studio, year, how many theaters it was released at, etc. 
##### Data from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/

### 2. Using the Play Library
 Make a cute little game using sprites.


### 3. Data Visualization
I have no idea what to dow with this but hopefully something cool.
