# Final Project

## Possible Ideas

### 1. Using the Speech Library
#### Ummmm maybe having an icon move on the screen dependant on the pitch of your voice to create drawings with voice.


### 2. Using the Play Library
#### Make a cute little game using sprites.


### 3. Data Visualization
#### I have no idea what to dow with this but hopefully something cool.
