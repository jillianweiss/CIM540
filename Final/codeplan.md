## Top 100 Opening Weekend Box Office Movie Releases Data Visualization

This program is a data visualization that takes data from  http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/ and displays it in various ways according to different options.

* Array of 100 movie ojects
* Object has: Opening Weekend Gross, Production Studio, Number of theaters, and Date of opening weekend. 

First, I need to create my array of movies. Then, according to the numbers in the array I will display a bar graph based on the data using the graphica.js library (or not, I'll just create a series of bars or "movie tickets" with different sizes - depending on the amount of money each movie made on opening weekend).
